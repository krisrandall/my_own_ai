# My Own AI

*A simple LLM - to run on your own machines - for developers who want easy set up of their own AI for projects*

As a software developer and entrepreneur in the 20s,  
I want AI intergration into my various projects.  

I don't need a super intelligent model,  
but I want one that I can run myself.

I want to provide custom training, or at least context,   
and I want API access to it.   

This repo is my attempt at achieving this vision for myself.

I'll update the README with usage notes and details as we progress along.
